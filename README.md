# CARD-BATTLE-GAME-V2.0
Partial overhaul of the previous project CARD-BATTLE-GAME and addition of elements and new mechanics

#OLD: https://github.com/InitnelaV/CARD-BATTLE-GAME

The V2 of a basic CBG (closer to a turn-based RPG)
This "game is rudimentary," more focused on mechanics than the enjoyment of gameplay.

Several enemy classes are included, each with increasing strength and HP as classes are defeated (values can be adjustedâ€”for instance, to ensure the game runs correctly, I set a regeneration usage limit of 80 with HP recovery ranging between 60 and 80).

Halfway through, the hero encounters a mage who makes them evolve

Magic can be used three times per enemy class, with the counter resetting after each class. Each class has its own background and music.

If all classes are defeated, a victory message appears. If the player dies, a Game Over screen is displayed. You'll need to readjust the enemies' damage and HP, of course. Feel free to use and modify it however you like! ðŸ˜Š

NB: The sound files being large, I split them into two ZIPs. You'll need to gather the samples into a single 'Sounds' folder.

NB2: The character design isnâ€™t mine but that of the amazing Nobody Saves the World! ðŸ˜‰
